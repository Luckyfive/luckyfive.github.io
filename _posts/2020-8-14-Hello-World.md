title: Trying out Jekyll
—-

I’ve always wanted to set something up with Jekyll, but I’ve never gotten around to it. This time I’m setting this up using my iPhone via the Working Copy app. 

I found it super complicated to fork a repo via iPhone without having to buy some other app. I ended up forcing the GitHub website to render the desktop version and forking the Jekyll Now repo that way. 

Overall I’m impressed how easy it is to set up and use.
